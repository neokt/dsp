These materials are designed to ensure you are ready to succeed in the
Metis data science bootcamp. Students should budget **60+ hours** to complete the pre-work.

**All exercises _must_ be completed before the first day of class.**

## <a name="section-c"></a>3.  Mac vs Windows

###Case for Mac over Windows

**Most people use Macs. They *are* expensive, but they work really well and they have a Linux-similar operating system that lets you just get down to business.  That way, you can spend more time on data science and less time trouble-shooting.**  

**The bootcamp is intense.  Spending time wrestling with compatibility stuff you really don't have to has a high opportunity cost.**  

Many Windows users aren’t used to using their computers in the full range of ways that are necessary. In summary, we find that things are more difficult to set up on Windows, and Windows users are less comfortable setting up even simple things. This common combination leads to large productivity hurdles and setbacks to class progress when everyone has to wait for a Windows user to get individual help. On top of this, it's common for productive data scientists to not use Windows, and in particular the instructional staff at Metis **does not** and **should not** spend their time troubleshooting Windows issues.

Specific Examples (of what's more difficult on Windows):
* setting PATH
* installing common packages
* installing a compiler toolchain
* accessing compressed files
* downloading remote files
* using X windows
* writing shell scripts
* scheduling tasks

Windows is discouraged, but some people are actually productive on Windows. It’s like an evolutionary disadvantage; if you’re successful anyway it sometimes means your other traits are quite good.  If you really want to run Windows, maybe you should. But we don’t like to put students in a position where we can’t help them, and **we don’t support Windows.**

If you want to spend time learning how to configure things, I recommend learning how to configure Linux over learning how to configure Windows.


###Running Windows - Don't Do It

**Q:  Can I run Windows for the bootcamp, instead of Unix or Linux?**  
A: The short answer is this: **Don't run Windows.**

The slightly longer answer is that it is possible to run Windows, but everything is harder. I've never had a student do the class with Windows. I had a student start the class with Windows, but by the second day that student went out and bought a new computer because it was too hard to keep up in Windows.


###If not Mac, if not Windows, then ---> Linux

You don't necessarily need to buy a new computer. Here are some alternatives:

 * **Linux Virtual Machine:**  If your computer is fairly powerful, you could run a Linux Virtual Machine inside your normal Windows install. This requires some configuration, but at least you end up with a working Linux instead of having to try to make Windows do things.
 * **Install Linux on your computer instead of or alongside Windows:**  Then you can boot to Linux instead of booting to Windows. Again, there is a good deal of configuration to be done to get this to work well, in general. We've had a couple people do the class with Linux this way.
 * **EC2:**  You could `ssh` into a remote Linux machine on EC2 and do all your work there. This requires some setup but perhaps less than the above two options. You'll mostly forgo a graphical interface, most likely, and you'll be paying for your computing by the hour.
 * **Git Bash:** You could try to use git-bash and/or other tools to try to make Windows achieve the functionality of Linux/MacOS. This becomes pretty frustrating pretty frequently and may limit the tools you can use.
